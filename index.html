	<h2>GENESIS MORAN</h2>
	<p>
		Genesis’ passion for connections lead her to self-tailor her Bachelor’s degree, and it was this same need for unifying different fields/ideas that brought her to code. Essentially, coding serves as the bridge between her greatest loves: Art and Science. With a background which spans from Science Communication, Video Editing, Grant Writing, to Management, she comes into the Web Development field with an array of methods for tackling problems. She is hawk-eyed and resourceful, a dedicated visual thinker that likes to dissect and display information from multiple angles.
